# Godot Android Streaming Texture (GAST) plugin

This is a Godot Android plugin that leverages [Godot's support for OpenGL external textures](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/36342)
in order to enable rendering and interaction with Android view components in a Godot app's scenegraph.

This can be used for the following use cases within Godot games / apps:
- Playing video for all codecs supported by the target platform
(e.g: [mp4 video playback](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1EivylJMbkO9GymIkv8D25vOIxNevDT2C/view?usp=sharing) in Godot on an Android device)
- Embedding and displaying webviews provided by the target platform
- Embedding and displaying views and UIs from the target platform
- Supporting cameras and ARCore on Android
